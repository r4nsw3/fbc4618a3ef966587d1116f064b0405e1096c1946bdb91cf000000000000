  |   Riddle me this: what sumo, walls and dancing have in common? The      |
  |   answer is: all of these elements formed Tetsumo Party!                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Tetsumo Party is a game where sumo warriors gather to join an         |
  |   unconventional contest, inspired by Japanese TV shows. They need to   |
  |   fit into the funny-shaped holes in an approaching bamboo wall,        |
  |   otherwise... well, let's say that it will result in rather            |
  |   ridiculous manner.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But what's better than winning alone? Fighting your friends, of       |
  |   course! In Tetsumo Party you can gather up to 4 people in a           |
  |   hilarious face-off confrontation.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What is the challenge? You need to control every limb separately.     |
  |   And remember - incoming bamboo walls aren't that forgiving.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Little distractions will happen, such as a waiter bringing you      |
  |     food and refreshments. You can stretch out your hand for them,      |
  |     but watch out for the incoming wall                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The game features single player as well as cooperative and versus   |
  |     local multiplayer modes                                             |
